=> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
=> HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

=>http methods are:- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE.

1. GET: GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
2. POST: POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
3. PUT: PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
    The difference between POST and PUT is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.
4. DELETE: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
5. PATCH: The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
    PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource . PATCH is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data.4444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444m
